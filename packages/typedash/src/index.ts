/**
 * @description
 * This module is meant to re-export and implement all utility functions.
 * Reason for doing it this way is so `map` is always the same implementation
 * instead of sometimes coming from `fp-ts` and sometimes coming from `ramda`.
 * Also allows us to override functions to "fix" or "change" them and not
 * have to update imports throughout the code base.
 *
 * @note
 * Do not import from outside this module when implementing functions
